# Feature Requests & Implementation Tasks

## 🎨 Clock Style Preset System

### Overview
Replace the "Clock Mode" section in the Real-Time Clock configuration with a new "Clock View" feature that allows users to select from multiple clock display styles. This visual preset system will enhance the user experience by providing various aesthetically pleasing clock designs.

### Current State
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/session.tsx` (lines 198-226)
- **Current Section**: "Clock Mode" with Speed Mode and Real-Time Mode selection
- **Component**: `components/ClockDisplay.tsx` (single display format)

### Required Changes

#### 1. Replace "Clock Mode" Section with "Clock View"

**File**: `app/(tabs)/session.tsx`

- **Remove**: The entire "Clock Mode" card section (lines 198-226) that contains:
  - Speed Mode button with "Accelerate time flow" description
  - Real-Time Mode button with "Normal time flow" description
  
- **Add**: New "Clock View" section with:
  - Title: "Clock View"
  - Description: "Choose your preferred clock display style"
  - A "Preset" button positioned in the top-right corner of the card
  - Preview of current selected clock style
  - Tapping the preset button opens a modal/sheet with available clock styles

#### 2. Create Clock Style Preset System

**New Types** (add to `src/services/ClockService.ts` or new file):

```typescript
export type ClockStyle = 
  | 'analog-classic'      // Classic analog clock with hour/minute hands
  | 'analog-minimalist'   // Minimalist analog with thin lines
  | 'digital-modern'      // Large digital numbers, modern font
  | 'digital-lcd'         // LCD/segment display style
  | '8bit-retro'          // 8-bit pixel art style clock
  | 'circular-progress'   // Circular progress bar style
  | 'flip-clock'          // Flip clock animation style
  | 'binary'              // Binary clock representation

export interface ClockStyleDefinition {
  id: ClockStyle;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  thumbnail?: string; // Optional preview image
  category: 'analog' | 'digital' | 'creative';
}
```

**Clock Style Library** (define available styles):

```typescript
export const CLOCK_STYLES: ClockStyleDefinition[] = [
  {
    id: 'analog-classic',
    name: 'Classic Analog',
    description: 'Traditional clock with hour and minute hands',
    category: 'analog'
  },
  {
    id: 'analog-minimalist',
    name: 'Minimalist Analog',
    description: 'Clean, minimal design with thin lines',
    category: 'analog'
  },
  {
    id: 'digital-modern',
    name: 'Modern Digital',
    description: 'Large, easy-to-read digital display',
    category: 'digital'
  },
  {
    id: 'digital-lcd',
    name: 'LCD Display',
    description: 'Retro LCD segment display style',
    category: 'digital'
  },
  {
    id: '8bit-retro',
    name: '8-Bit Retro',
    description: 'Pixel art style inspired by classic games',
    category: 'creative'
  },
  {
    id: 'circular-progress',
    name: 'Circular Progress',
    description: 'Progress ring showing time advancement',
    category: 'creative'
  },
  {
    id: 'flip-clock',
    name: 'Flip Clock',
    description: 'Animated flip-style numbers',
    category: 'digital'
  },
  {
    id: 'binary',
    name: 'Binary Clock',
    description: 'For the tech-savvy: time in binary',
    category: 'creative'
  }
];
```

#### 3. Update State Management

**File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx`

Add to session state:
```typescript
interface SessionState {
  // ... existing properties
  clockStyle: ClockStyle; // Default: 'digital-modern'
}
```

Add new action:
```typescript
| { type: 'UPDATE_CLOCK_STYLE'; payload: ClockStyle }
```

#### 4. Refactor ClockDisplay Component

**File**: `components/ClockDisplay.tsx`

Current component shows a single format. Needs to:

- Accept `clockStyle` prop
- Render different visual components based on selected style
- Create sub-components for each clock style:
  - `AnalogClockView` - Canvas/SVG-based analog clock
  - `DigitalClockView` - Large digital numbers
  - `LCDClockView` - LCD segment style
  - `EightBitClockView` - Pixel art rendering
  - `CircularProgressClockView` - Circular progress indicator
  - `FlipClockView` - Flip animation digits
  - `BinaryClockView` - Binary representation

**Component Structure**:
```typescript
export default function ClockDisplay({ onSessionComplete }: ClockDisplayProps) {
  const { state } = useAppContext();
  const clockStyle = state.session.clockStyle;
  
  // ... existing state and logic
  
  const renderClockStyle = () => {
    switch (clockStyle) {
      case 'analog-classic':
        return <AnalogClockView time={clockData.displayTime} variant="classic" />;
      case 'analog-minimalist':
        return <AnalogClockView time={clockData.displayTime} variant="minimalist" />;
      case 'digital-modern':
        return <DigitalClockView time={clockData.displayTime} variant="modern" />;
      case 'digital-lcd':
        return <LCDClockView time={clockData.displayTime} />;
      case '8bit-retro':
        return <EightBitClockView time={clockData.displayTime} />;
      // ... other cases
      default:
        return <DigitalClockView time={clockData.displayTime} variant="modern" />;
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {renderClockStyle()}
      {/* Keep existing session info, slot info, etc. */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### 5. Add Clock Style Selector Modal

**New File**: `components/ClockStyleSelector.tsx`

Create a modal/bottom sheet that displays all available clock styles in a grid:

```typescript
interface ClockStyleSelectorProps {
  visible: boolean;
  currentStyle: ClockStyle;
  onSelect: (style: ClockStyle) => void;
  onClose: () => void;
}

export function ClockStyleSelector({ 
  visible, 
  currentStyle, 
  onSelect, 
  onClose 
}: ClockStyleSelectorProps) {
  // Render grid of clock styles with previews
  // Show category sections (Analog, Digital, Creative)
  // Highlight currently selected style
  // Preview animation on tap
}
```

#### 6. Update Session Page - Running State

**File**: `app/(tabs)/session.tsx` (lines 335-389)

When session is running, add a small preset button to allow changing clock style without stopping:

- Position: Top-right corner of the clock display area
- Icon: Palette or style icon
- Action: Opens ClockStyleSelector modal
- The clock should smoothly transition between styles

#### 7. Visual Design Reference

Based on provided images:

**Analog Classic** (Image 1):
- Simple clock face with hour/minute markers
- Clean hour and minute hands
- Subtle shadow and depth

**Minimalist** (Image 2):
- Ultra-clean design
- Thin lines, minimal markings
- Focus on the time digits

**8-Bit Retro** (New requirement):
- Pixelated font style
- Retro gaming aesthetic
- Blocky numbers with pixel art border
- Optional: animated pixel sparkles

**Circular Progress** (Image 3):
- Progress ring showing session advancement
- Time displayed in center
- Color gradient based on progress

**Digital LCD**:
- Seven-segment display style
- Monospace font
- Optional: slight glow effect

1. Clock displays in selected style
2. Small preset button visible (non-intrusive)
3. User can tap to change style without stopping session
4. Clock smoothly transitions to new style
5. Session continues uninterrupted

#### 10. Future Enhancements (Later Phases)

- Custom clock styles (user-created)
- Dynamic color themes per clock style
- Animated backgrounds matching clock style
